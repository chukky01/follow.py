# follow.py
A simple demonstration of OOP
The code calls the follow() method on user_1, passing user_2 as an argument. This increments the number of followers of user_2 by 1 and the number of users that user_1 is following by 1.

Finally, the code prints the values of the followers and following properties for both users.

In simple terms, the code creates two users, Paul and Jane. Paul follows Jane, which increments Jane's number of followers by 1 and Paul's number of users following by 1. The code then prints the number of followers and users following for both users.
